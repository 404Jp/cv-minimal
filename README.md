# Web Portfolio 

This is the repository for my web portfolio, built with Astro, TypeScript, CSS, and JavaScript. The portfolio showcases my professional skills and experience, organized across different sections.

## Project Structure

The portfolio is divided into four main pages:

- **Home**: (`/index`) An overview of my skills and professional background.
- **Projects**: (`/projects`) A gallery showcasing my projects. Each project links to its associated GitHub repository or related URL when clicked.
- **Certificates**: (`/certificates`) A gallery displaying my certifications, which also link to the associated certification details or relevant URLs.
- **Education and Experience**: (`/time`) A timeline highlighting my educational background and work experience.
